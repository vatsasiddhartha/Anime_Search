# AnimSearch

AnimSearch is a Flutter-based anime and manga discovery application that uses data from the [Jikan API](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#).

This repository contains a **customized and enhanced version** of an existing open-source project. The application was upgraded, modified, and extended as part of my hands-on Flutter development learning and experimentation.
